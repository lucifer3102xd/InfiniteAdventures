# InfiniteAdventures
Randomly generated coherent text adventures via GPT-2 and Mathematica.


Nothing limits you in the story.

Example 1 [user prompts are in italics]: "Your name is *Lance*. You are a *detective* in the land of *Calgary*. Your job is to protect the city of Calgary. You will be found guilty of following the law. *You are not afraid of repercussions for following the law.* You will have to live with your conscience. Don't worry about who you are. *You walk proudly through the streets.* But your conscience can't alter your name. The Moon is a special symbol. *You wonder what your name means.* Don't let the name fool you. It's all yours. *You go to the local saloon.* You pay a fine and will be sent home. It's all up to you. You can change it. You've earned enough. *You ask what the fine is for.* It's not worth the money. Then you go to the nearest grocery store. The store sells everything and the prices are good. *You buy some bananas.* You make a purchase on your way home. You check on your Mom for anything. The store is full. You buy some chocolate milk."

Uses GPT-2 neural net from its repository to procedurally generate random new worlds to explore via text.

Coded in Mathematica. You may be able to access Mathematica through your university or by free download (time-limited). There is also a reasonable Home edition that you can use here.


Example 2 [user prompts are in italics]: Your name is *Lance*. You are a *translator* in the land of *Calgary*. I am your guide. I am your guide to the future of the world. *You ask "Is the future sustainable?"* then you ask for economic and political power. *You ask "What are the motivations for those?"* Then you ask for peace. You ask for freedom. You ask for justice. *You ask "Is it too late?"* and so on. *You ask "What is the best way to begin?"* How much of your time do you spend with others? *You say "It is important who you spend your time with."* Or, "It is important who you spend your time with." *Your gestalt is with your loved ones.* That is very important. That is the right way to do things. *You ask "What is the first thing to do?"* then you ask for justice. You ask for peace. *Then you ask for love.* Which is the most important thing you ask for? You ask first for love. Then you ask for freedom. Then you ask for justice. So, you ask for it. *Then, you see a beautiful princess on a white horse.* She is asking for love. *Ask what love is.* Ask if love is a physical thing. Ask if love is real. *Ask if anything besides love is real.* If everything in your life is not love, then you are not a Christian. *You agree.* You say "Is there a world where their love is genuine?" then you ask for justice. *The princess dismounts her horse.* The king smashes her head against a wall. *The princess stands up and says "Now I am the Queen, Alexandria."* Then you say "Let's go." *The princess says "Where shall we go, Lance?"* *You ask "How shall we go?"* Then you ask for recognition. You ask for power. *The princess says "Mount my steed with me and I will make you my king."* Then the king throws her into the sea. *You rescue Queen Alexandria and you drown the king.* *You say "Why did you do that?" But the king can not answer as he has drowned.* Instead, he says "I owe you more than you, King of the Seven Kingdoms." *You are shocked into silence,  that he survived and that he recognized you.* You are cut off from your family. *You think that is for the best.*
