# InfiniteAdventures
Randomly generated coherent text adventures via GPT-2 and Mathematica.


Nothing limits you in the story.

Example [user prompts are in italics]: "Your name is *Lance*. You are a *detective* in the land of *Calgary*. Your job is to protect the city of Calgary. You will be found guilty of following the law. *You are not afraid of repercussions for following the law.* You will have to live with your conscience. Don't worry about who you are. *You walk proudly through the streets.* But your conscience can't alter your name. The Moon is a special symbol. *You wonder what your name means.* Don't let the name fool you. It's all yours. *You go to the local saloon.* You pay a fine and will be sent home. It's all up to you. You can change it. You've earned enough. *You ask what the fine is for.* It's not worth the money. Then you go to the nearest grocery store. The store sells everything and the prices are good. *You buy some bananas.* You make a purchase on your way home. You check on your Mom for anything. The store is full. You buy some chocolate milk."
